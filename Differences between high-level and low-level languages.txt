When you hear programming languages referred to as "High level" or "Low Level" it may, at first, seem confusing. The relative adjectives "high" and "low" are being used in reference to the amount of abstraction from machine language. Machine language is a set of instructions executed by a CPU, and the only language the CPU truly understands. A "low" level language would be one that is relatively close to machine language, whereas a "high" level language would be one that is similar to human speech. Low level languages work very closely with the system hardware and operating system. High level languages use a "compiler" or an "interpreter" to create machine code from the readable code. 

Examples of low level code are Assembly and C. These are older languages that have been around for almost a century, though there is debate on whether "C" is a low level or "medium" level language. Low level languages are **very difficult to use.** High level languages are easily recognizable because of how ubiquitous they are in modern programming. Some examples are Python, Java, and Pascal. These languages make the **process of developing much simpler**
