# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a way of enabling computers to learn from data without correcting mistakes. It focuses mostly on using data to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn. It is more dependent on human intervention, also used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems. Machine learning is another way of using AI. Machine learning works by collecting data, training, and testing.

Real world examples which exist today from the machine learning is Siri, Alexa, self-driving cars which this has resulted on how we use technology today.
