## There are many ways to learn to code, including a computer science (CS) degree, a certification, or teaching yourself, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks:

<p>  
A CS degree provides a broad foundation of knowledge, including foundational concepts, modern technologies, and a variety of topics like algorithms, databases, and operating systems. It can take four years to complete. A CS degree can lead to above-average salaries, with a median annual wage of $90,000. However, it can be a significant financial and time commitment. </p>
<p>  
A certification, like a coding bootcamp, can offer career-focused training in a short amount of time. However, bootcamps may not provide the same depth of knowledge as a CS degree. </p>
<p> 
Self-taught programmers can choose their own learning path and pace, and there are many free and low-cost resources available. However, self-taught programmers may struggle with accountability and structure, and it can be difficult to know where to start. Self-teaching can be effective, but it requires a lot of discipline. </p>
