### Programming Languages share some resemblance, but they are majorly different
The two main types of programming languages are high-level and low-level programming. There are many different languages to choose from within high-level languages, such as Python, C#, JavaScript, and more. High-level language is easier due to it being oriented as a human language and having an understandable syntax into which you can read and comprehend it as you go along. Faster development times since it has less coding and debugging that the programmer has to work on. More memory is used to do built-in functionality, require more code for simple tasks, and runtime environments. Majorly used for software development, web development, and database management.

Low-Level Language has languages such as Assembly Language, and Machine Code is more oriented to machine language and hardware, which will make the syntax difficult to understand. Unlike high-level language, more coding and debugging is needed, which will produce longer development times. Less memory is used due to less built-in functionality, direct hardware access, manual memory management, and no runtime environments. Mostly used for system programming, device drivers, and embedded systems.
