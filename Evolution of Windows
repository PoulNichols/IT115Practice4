The evolution of Windows, which is MS's flagship operating system spans over several decades.

The first operating system, also known as Windows 1.0, was founded in 1985. It included basic features like windows, icons, and menus.

Another major upgrade that happened was in the year 1998. The Windows 98 had integrated internet, and support USB devices, with improved multimedia features.

And currently the most latest establishment is Windows 11, which has a cleaner design, and better support for gaming and online work environments.

Each Windows version was built upon the previous, improving user experience.
