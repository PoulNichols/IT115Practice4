When developing software, targeting popular operating systems is key, though trends shift over time. Currently, Android leads the smartphone market with around 85% market share. Its open-source nature and integration with Google services like Play Store and Chrome make it a critical platform for developers aiming for widespread reach.

On the other hand, while iOS holds a smaller share, its seamless integration with Apple hardware and a loyal user base make it an attractive choice. Known for its quality and user experience, iOS remains a strong contender for developers. Both Android and iOS present valuable opportunities, each with unique advantages.
